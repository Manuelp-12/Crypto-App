# Portfolio View

Users can view coins that they previously added to thier portfolio, as well as their amount holding and price. At the top of the screen, a new statistic "Portfolio Value" shows where the user can see their total amount holdings and the weighted percentage change of their coins within the last 24 hours. A plus also appears at the top left of the screen where the user can add more coins to their portfolio.

Users can select which coins they want to add to their portfolio by scrolling through a list of coins or searching by the coin's name or symbol. Once they click a coin they are asked to input an amount holding, and the current value updates to show the price of that many holdings. Finally they can click a save button which saves to their portfolio.
